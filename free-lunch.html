<h4>
There are free lunches
</h4>

<p>
Some people rake millions out of thin air, even though the books tell me the
markets are efficient. I see 10xers in front of my eyes, while others deny their
existence (while celebrating olympic medals of exceptional achievement).

<p>
There are free lunches. The margins might be thin, but arbitrage works; even the
future isn't evenly distributed.

<p>
There are free lunches. If there weren't, evolution wouldn't work.
