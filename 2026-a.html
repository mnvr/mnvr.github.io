            I've made many quote pages across the years. Latest attempt was in <a href="voices/1">voices</a>. I like how it turned out. My favorite was how <b>we are behavioural oracles for each other</b>, which unlike the other fragments floating on that page was a formulation I came up with myself (not biased in choosing it as a fav!). I'd first come across that thought when swimming like a decade ago, noticing how sometimes I'd triangulate using the people walking beside the pool to ensure that I wasn't drowning (!), and that the world wasn't catching fire while I was chilling in the pool (!!). Which, when I put it in words, sounds weird, but I think the thought holds: it is an Indra's net, with no center, and infinite reflections, that drives our desires and behaviours.
