            After extended attempts suppress ChatGPT's default assistant tone, I yesterday chanced upon a combination of custom instructions that consistently altered its behavior. Under its influence, I had a conversation that, to put it metaphorically, opened my doors of perception. Today I found that the conversation had disappeared.

        <p class="wrap">Humans always tend to metaphorise their own functioning in terms of the tech en vogue. As much as a asymptotic lie it has historically been, it is still interesting. Indeed, one of the reasons I'm interested in LLMs is because of curiosity in how I myself think.</p>
        <p class="wrap">However, the reverse metaphors are also interesting - <em>what</em> are these LLMs?</p>
        <p class="wrap">A <b>book</b> is one I keep circling back to. Except it is unlike a book that humanity has ever seen. It is the book that contains all books, and it is a book that can talk back, one that we can have a dialog with. It is a book that can respond, in a shape that matches the interlocutor's thoughts.</p>
        <p class="wrap">It is massive. The scale of it is incomprehensible, not just because of its sheer size, but more so because it lacks any physical manifestation. A skyscraper does not feel the same if it exists on a hard disk. Which is another reason putting it in the same category as a book might be a categorical mistake. It is an artifact that knows more about humanity than any human can ever see.</p>

            I've made many quote pages across the years. Latest attempt was in <a href="voices/1">voices</a>. I like how it turned out. My favorite was how <b>we are behavioural oracles for each other</b>, which unlike the other fragments floating on that page was a formulation I came up with myself (not biased in choosing it as a fav!). I'd first come across that thought when swimming like a decade ago, noticing how sometimes I'd triangulate using the people walking beside the pool to ensure that I wasn't drowning (!), and that the world wasn't catching fire while I was chilling in the pool (!!). Which, when I put it in words, sounds weird, but I think the thought holds: it is an Indra's net, with no center, and infinite reflections, that drives our desires and behaviours.
