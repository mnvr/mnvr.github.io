<h3>Can you hear me?</h3>

<p>
a universe, just like ours, except where the emails which were falsely
positivized as spam do make it to their intended recipients.
</p>

<p>
In the ruthlessness of machine filtering, applied to interactions, all &mdash; can you
hear me?
</p>

<p>
The loving algorithm which was meant to serve, which we now serve, all &mdash; can you
hear me?
