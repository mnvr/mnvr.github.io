<h3>Shiva</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Repetition is the shadow of structure&rdquo;, I read somewhere.
</p>

<p>
This is true of code, philosophy, and life. Well, that escalated fast, but that
is common in most trains of thought I sit in for a while. All tracks lead to
Rome indeed, and not only that, when I get down low enough the dependencies
become circular.
</p>

<p>
It is true, but incomplete, for each repetition is different. This is where I
used to, and still trip up, say when trying to find useful abstractions in the
programs I write. Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds, but most of my
mind is small, and it helps me remain sane; still sometimes I am necessitated to
step outside and face the sharp edges of reification to find the structure that
generates the repetition that I'm trying to replicate.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning, Brahma created the universe, but it was lifeless, repetitive.
</p>

<p>
Not knowing what to do, he went to Shiva, blankly pointing at his creation. It
was Shiva who made it alive.
</p>

<p>
What Shiva does, is, goes by many names. Destruction. Chaos. Randomness. It is
that makes repetitions alive.
</p>

<p>
God does not play dice, Professor Einstein, he is dice.
