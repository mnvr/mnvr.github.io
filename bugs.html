<h3>
What is a bug?
</h3>

<p>
<mark>A bug is something that was working earlier but now isn't.</mark> That's
it. Everything else is a feature.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this essay, I will try to justify this definition, and also state
why it matters (spoiler: it doesn't really, except as a way of thinking about
things (<em>that's what's called philosophy, Manav</em>)).
</p>

<hr>

<p>
This definition might seem like a very low bar; <em>au contraire</em> it is too
high. Only very few software projects satisfy this threshold - Linux, Windows,
the "Web" (I can't come up with a fourth example, taking my definition in the
strictest sense).
</p>

<p>
And whether or not to satify this definition is a
<em>business</em> decision, not an engineering decision. By business decision I
mean that someone with power deliberately made the choice to satisfy this
threshold (programmers left to their own would do anything except fix bugs).
</p>

<ul>
<li>For Linux it was Linus with the forceful <em>&#8220;Never break
userspace&#8221;</em></li>
<li>For Windows it was Microsoft with a literal business decision</li>
<li>For the Web I don't know who were the individuals who insisted on it in the
early days, when the seed was sown, but I'm <a
href="https://whatwg.org/faq#removing-bad-ideas">thankful to them</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The projects that do satisfy it are illustrious though - the Linux kernel
(), Microsoft Windows
