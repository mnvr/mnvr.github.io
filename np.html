<p>
I will now listen to only new music.
</p>

<p>
I used to have a voracious and varied diet of music, which caused me to find music that appealed to me (most popular music doesn't).

<p>
Now I find myself unable to find new music, and I don't care for nostalgia, so I need to go back to the younger self way of consuming large amounts of fresh music to find what clicks.
</p>

<p>
Music that is being made <em>now</em>, by artists still producing. Any artist whose name I have heard already is disqualified, unless it is a new song by them.
</p>

<p>
The era of playlists and mixtapes is gone, but maybe I will still post what I find here!
