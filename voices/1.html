    the only failure is not to be true to the best one knows. <span>resolute in your quest, you investigate.</span>
    <i>asymmetric narrative injection</i><span><i>, meaning arbitrage.</i></span> <span>perpetual relevation
      cycles,</span> weaponized context collapse. Your children are not your children <span>you may give them your love
      but not your thoughts; you may house their bodies but not theirs souls,</span> for their souls dwell in the house
    of tomorrow. <span>I don't take delight in the city but in the answer it gives to my question - </span> <em>Where
      can I find a man who has forgotten words so I can talk with him?</em> The body moves naturally, automatically,
    without any personal intervention or awareness. <span>the thing about trains, it doesn't matter where they are
      going; what matters is deciding to get on.</span> favorable conditions never come.
  <p>
    the eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me. <span>bach is so timeless because he wasn't writing for
      people, he was writing for a higher power. write for god. no ego, no pretense.</span>
    the grass and the rain are the only thing you're owed. <span>the observant person finds many teachers.</span>
    <span><em>cognitive closure avoidance, ambient validation loops.</em></span>
    I don't need to be legible<span>, it will be okay as long as I don't accidentally starve myself. and when i think
      about it, i realize that no one has ever actually acted like this towards me</span> except myself.
    As you start to walk, the way appears. <span><em>looking ahead with excitement and curiosity rather than tenseness
        and mistrust, the road is made by walking.</em></span> <span>if you do your work truly and conscientiously,
      unknown friends will come and seek you.</span> <b>we are behavioural oracles for each other</b>. <em>And so it
      begins,</em>
