<h3 class="lightyear">All the light we cannot see</h3>

<p>
Some stories have names that are irresistible. <cite>Vaster than empires and
more slow</cite>. <cite>A Clockwork Orange</cite>. <cite>Flow my tears, the
policeman said</cite>.
</p>

<p>
However, some of them have names so sublime that I'll never read them, for fear
of spoiling the sublimity. <cite>The god of small things</cite>, <cite>The
unbearable lightness of being</cite>, <cite>All the light we cannot see</cite>.
</p>

<p>
(That, and this isn't the sort of stories I like, but hey, never let facts get
in the way of a good thought.)
