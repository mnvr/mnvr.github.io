<h3>Everything is possible in software, but!</h3>

<p>
I had a boss once (hi JP!), who, whenever his product counterpart asked him if
some particular feature or task was doable, used to reply with the same phrase
&mdash; &ldquo;Everything is possible in software&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Initially, I thought it was just a pet phrase of his. It took me a lot of
distance in time and space to see the full extent of the truth that the
statement implies. Everything really is possible in software, literally.
</p>

<p>
We have been exploring words for millenia and yet haven&rsquo;t exhausted either
our penchant for trying to express the inexpressible (hi me!) or love for
reading such attempts (hi you!).
</p>

<p>
We have been exploring symbolic manipulation for centuries and it feels
we&rsquo;re barely getting started.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ve been programming for less than a century. Forget barely, we
haven&rsquo;t even gotten started. The limits of software will be further than
both the written word and the mathematician&rsquo;s symbol, or at least a
curious amalgamation of both, and will lead us God knows where. Everything is
literally possible, in software.
</p>

<p>
Curiously, everything is also hard. As someone who works open source, what
surprises me is not when users expect a thing (they do, but that&rsquo;s to be
expected), but when every once in a while, a fellow programmer pops in as a user
and uses the phrase "that should be easy, eh?".
</p>

<p>
Nothing in software is easy. That&rsquo;s a blanket statement, but on nuance it
is not quite true - some things are easy. But the thing is, you <em>cannot</em>
tell, not easily, and definitely not from the outside.
</p>

<p>
Someone who is not familiar with the codebase, the organization that pecks on
it, dancing together under Conway&rsquo;s law, the money trail that feeds their
dance, the use cases, and a myriad of other things that make software more than
just programs, cannot tell from the outside what is easy.
</p>

<p>
Yet curiously, it is only fellow programmers, who should be aware of this, who
make this mistake of estimating what they already know cannot be estimated.
</p>

<p>
I now know that JP&rsquo;s refrain was both a childish call of possibility, and
a cynical take on the difficulty, of software.
