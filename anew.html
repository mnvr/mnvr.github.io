<p>
Every once in a while, like the cycles of the moon but not as regular or
enlightening, I like to start anew. Burn away old things, bridges too, and
start anew.
</p>

<p>
This time I'm doing something new when starting anew â€” I'm not burning the old,
but just letting it be. What was will wither away, but not that's on time, not
me. This also makes this cycle different from the ones that have come before it;
can you do that, o moon?
</p>

<p>
It's 02:03 AM now, and I'm starting anew.
