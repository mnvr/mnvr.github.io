<h2>Nowhere left to go</h2>

<p>
Jobs' mother wrote a book, <cite><b>Anywhere But Here</b></cite>.
</p>

<p>
It's one of those books whose <a href="all-the-light">title</a> says it all. I have no interest in reading the book, I know what it contains, I live it.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I feel I've been everywhere, and there is nowhere I want to go, but since I'd rather be anywhere but here, so I can't stay here either. There is nowhere left to go.
</p>

<p>
Then I see a leaf, a tree, a clearing in the middle of trees, in the middle of the city but sealed off from it, the sunlight streaming through their canopy. A life beckons me.
