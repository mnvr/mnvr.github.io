<h1>Python, Electron and Bangalore</h1>

<p>
Recently I had to use a Python library for some task.
</p>

<p>
I'd used, liked, Python more than a decade ago, before the destructive third crusade, when I moved on. Still, it is so pervasive, that every once in a while, I need to use it for some task. Each time, it is a pain.
</p>

<p>
Each time, during the gulps of rational thought in the middle of anger, I wonder to myself - how is it possible that Python packaging can be so broken?
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Electron has been a lifesaver for me at work. When people, with their litany of accurate complaints, wonder why Electron is still used, I chuckle - silly children, they can't see the real world problem it solves.
</p>

<p>
That day, I chuckled, but for a different reason. Python and Electron are manifestations of the same phenomena.
</p>

<p>
They solve certain problems, like proteins clicking into shape, and once the problem is solved, there is no selection pressure to tween the shape further. The people who are not aware of the problem see only the warts, while the people who have the gap are thankful for the monstrous shape that fills.
</p>

<p>
The difference is thus in perspective - I have a positive valence towards Electron since I saw the gap before I saw the shape, while I have a negative valence towards Python because I see the chaotic shape and not the gap it fills.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
This phenomena is not just software. I have many more bad things to say about Bangalore than I have good. But still, it is in Bangalore I sit as I write this.
