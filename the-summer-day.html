<h3>The Summer Day</h3>

<p>
Who made the world?<br>
Who made the swan, and the black bear?<br>
Who made the grasshopper?<br>
This grasshopper, I mean —<br>
the one who has flung herself out of the grass,<br>
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,<br>
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down —<br>
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.<br>
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.<br>
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.<br>
I don't know exactly what a prayer is.<br>
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down<br>
into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,<br>
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,<br>
which is what I have been doing all day.<br>
Tell me, what else should I have done?<br>
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?<br>
Tell me, what is it you plan to do<br>
with your one wild and precious life?<br>
