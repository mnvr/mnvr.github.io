<h3>Momentum</h3>

<p>
There is a ridiculous fact that physicists have known for a few hundred years.
Objects in motion remain in motion.
</p>

<p>
This is completely counter intuitive, goes again common sense, and does not
match our expectation or perception. If thought about deeper, it seems to imply
some sort of a perpetual motion machine. I feel we read about this is high
school physics but do not register what it implies &mdash; or that's what
happened to me for the longest time.
</p>

<p>
But it is true. The Voyager will keep on flying till <em>eternity</em>, unless
something else comes along and stops it.
</p>

<p>
It is also a very calming fact.

<p>
I once read a quote from an executive of a huge company somewhere. I don't
remember who they were, or their words at all, but the gist of it (or what my
memory conjures) was that non-small organizations like multi-national companies
are like rudderless ships that have already set sail. The public, or
shareholders, have an illusion of control, but the truth is that the CEO can
neither make or break the company, it is travelling on its own momentum now.
</p>

<p>
There are exceptions to this, charismatic leaders, the Napoleans and the Jobs.
So it is not a hard fact of nature. But it is something that generally applies
to most companies that we deal with, the government that we live under, the
universities that we study in. There is no one in charge, they run on their own.
</p>

<p>
The executive was bemoaning how hard it was to get anything done, because the
company does not respond to commands. But he was also trying to show the flip
positive side of it - this inertia was a self defense the company had built up
to safeguard its existence in the face of a destructive figurehead.
</p>

<p>
This too is a very calming fact.

Go on grasshopper, change the world, and do it at your own pace. You might
succeed, and it is unlikely you'll break it.
