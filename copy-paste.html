<h1>Copy Paste</h1>

<p>
My favorite interview question (which I formulated but never asked anyone - yet!) is why copy pasting is better than refactoring.
</p>

<p>
If you feel disgusted, or can't answer, you're a midwit.
</p>

<p>
Copy pasted code never breaks anything that already works. Copy pasted code adapts to the task at hand, letting the internal structure of the problem show through, instead of enforcing an external structure. Copy pasted code is antifragile - it learns.
</p>

<p>
I've know this for a decade now, but still haven't been able to get myself to do it fully in practice. Surely there is reason why my obsessing over details, over well architected abstractions, over minimal primitives that compose well, is important?
</p>

<p>
It is just cope, I think. Copy pasting is how nature works. You and I share the same DNA, but not really. We have <i>copies</i>.
</p>

<p>
The reason I've not been able to fully embrace this learning is because I don't know how to make it sit with Whitehead's conjecture: that civilization grows when we manipulate symbols higher, higher, at ever dizzying heights where they lose any connection with what they once stood for, until they stand for other symbols which had eons ago lost any connection thus.
</p>

<p>
If there was only copy pasting, then there is no selection pressure to abstract, and without abstraction, the symbols I copy paste will not gain mana.
</p>

<p>
How can I copy paste yet embue the thing being copy pasted <a href="https://mrmr.io/mutations">more leverage over reality</a>?
