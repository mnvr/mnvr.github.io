<h3>Mind</h3>

<p>
The first memories from childhood, the last dream I had. I have been there in
all of them.
</p>

<p>
My favorite books have changed, so has the way I look, or the way I like my
coffee. I know there is a brain that underlies this activity, and there are
these thoughts that float above it, and both of these are constantly changing.
When I look close, I can see my mind as distinct from both of these.
</p>

<p>
<mark>Something hasn&rsquo;t changed</mark>, or so it seems. There has been
something that has been always there, witnessing.
</p>

<canvas width="270" height="168"></canvas>

<p>
Is that me? Or is that my mind? Am I my mind?
</p>
<p>
The mind is a series of changes, the ocean on which the waves wave, but the
consciousness does not change. The thoughts are the waves, that much is clear,
but is the mind the ocean, or consciounsess; are they different, or are they the
same?
</p>
<p>
And then there is that other question.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Is my mind in this world,<br>
or is the world in my mind?
</em>
