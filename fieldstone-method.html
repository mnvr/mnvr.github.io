<ul>
<li>One way for smart people to be happy is to express themselves, to put out in
the world the vast melange of thoughts and feelings whirling in their
heads.</li>
<li>Writing about a subject is a good way to learn about it.</li>
<li>Never attempt to write about what you don't care.</li>
<li>Every day is different; every idea is different; every mood is different; so
why should every project be the same.</li>
<li>There are no bad ideas, only ideas that don't fit the current work.</li>
</ul>
