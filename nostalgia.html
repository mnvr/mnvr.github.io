Nostalgia for different periods return in different cycles. Perhaps I&rsquo;m it
is because there's a seed that was planted in me back then that has yet to
bloom. It is also possible to feel the <b>nostalgia for the present</b>, of the
period I am still living in.

<li><i>
Maybe sometimes let things be a blur, an <b>incomprehensible noise</b>. Maybe
sometimes you shouldn&rsquo;t think.

<li><i>Regularly doing something you are bad at <b>without hope of getting
better</b>.</i></li>

Quotes from from a journal by <cite><a href="https://ctrl-c.club/~gome/journal/"
target="_blank">gome</a></cite>. It is <a href="css">rare to come across new
thoughts</a> in the echo chambers we float in, so I also wrote them a thank you
email (though I don't know if it&rsquo;ll <a href="algorithm">reach them</a>).
