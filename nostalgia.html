<h2>Nostalgia for the present</h2>

<section>
<p>
Nostalgia is part of building a narrative to process what's happened in your
life.
</p>

<p>
The feeling is something that takes shape in retrospect - feeling the general
feeling of a period you&rsquo;re living in is like tasting the roof of your
mouth: you usually don&rsquo;t, because you're acclimated to it. Thus every
period of life has a related period of first nostalgia, the first time we begin
to notice that period's unique feeling.
</p>

<p>
Having become aware of this dynamic, I started to realize at some point that I
could, in fact, feel the nostalgia of a period I was still living in.

Taken verbatim (with some rearrangement) from <cite><a
href="https://ctrl-c.club/~gome/journal/nostalgia.html"
target="_blank">Nostalgia for the present</a></cite> by <em>gome</em>. It is
<a href="css">rare to come across new thoughts</a> in the echo chambers we float
in, so I also wrote them a thank you email (though I don't know if it&rsquo;ll
<a href="algorithm">reach them</a>).
</p>

<p>
In the same post, they also write of nostalgia as seeds of flowers unbloomed...

The moods of different periods seem to return in different cycles. Perhaps
I&rsquo;m missing them because there's a seed that was planted in me back then
that has yet to bloom.

I enjoyed reading their journal entries on a quiet Sunday. Here are three more
snippets.

Maybe sometimes let things be a blur, an incomprehensible noise. Maybe sometimes
you shouldn&rsquo;t think (<cite><a

Regularly doing something you are bad at <em><b>without hope of getting
better</b></em>
