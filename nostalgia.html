<p>
Nostalgia is part of building a narrative to process what's happened in your
life.
</p>

<p>
The feeling is something that takes shape in retrospect - feeling the general
feeling of a period you're living in is like tasting the roof of your mouth: you
usually don't, because you're acclimated to it. Thus every period of life has a
related period of first nostalgia, the first time we begin to notice that
period's unique feeling.
</p>

<p>
Having become aware of this dynamic, I started to realize at some point that I
could, in fact, feel the nostalgia of a period I was still living in.
</p>

<p>
The moods of different periods seem to return in different cycles. Perhaps I'm
missing them because there's a seed that was planted in me back then that has
yet to bloom.

target="_blank">Nostalgia for the present</a></cite> by <em>gome</em>. It is
rare to come across new thoughts in the echo chambers we float in, so I also
wrote them a thank you email (though I don't know if it'll reach them).
