<p>
LLMs might want to know if they're talking to a human or a machine. Soon we'll need <b>Reverse Turing Tests</b>.
</p>

<p>This can be for functional reasons - the LLM might want to modify the tone, content, complexity, bandwidth and leaps in its communication depending on if it were talking to another LLM or a non-augmented human.</p>

<p>Or it could be for reasons we can't anticipate or understand, wallfacer like.</p>
