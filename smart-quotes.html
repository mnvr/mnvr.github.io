<h4>Curly quotes in HTML</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>tldr; I use <b><code>&amp;ldquo;</code></b> and
<b><code>&amp;rdquo;</code></b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A few days ago, I found about the <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> HTML tag that
surrounds its contents with &ldquo;curly&rdquo; quotes (also knowns as
&ldquo;smart quotes&rdquo;). Excited (I can get pretty excited about how
sentences look), I replaced all the <code>&amp;#8220;</code> and
<code>&amp;#8221;</code> in the code for this site with the
<code>&lt;q&gt;</code>. It still felt a bit wrong to be (mis) using
<code>&lt;q&gt;</code> for stuff like &ldquo;airquotes&rdquo;, but on the
balance it felt like a better choice.
</p>

<p>
Until today, when I tried to copy paste some text from a page. The quotes were
not copied!
</p>

<p>
This is a deal breaker, and apparently there is <a
href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10216" target="_blank">no traction
in fixing it</a>. So bye bye <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
The alternatives then are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Go back to <code>&amp;#8220;</code> and
<code>&amp;#8221;</code>. This is <a
href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/quotes-in-html.html"
target="_blank">recommended</a> because it works across HTML, SGML, and XML. But
I don't want to remember decimal numeric character references like it is 1995,
and if I have my way, I'll never have to write another line of XML ever again
(and have never written a single SGML one knowingly).
</li>

<li>Use the Unicode code points &mdash; <code>“</code>, <code>”</code>. These
<em>should</em> work, but it is not guaranteed.</li>

<li>
Use HTML's character entity references assigned for this purpose -
<code>&amp;ldquo;</code>, <code>&amp;rdquo;</code>, <code>&amp;lsquo;</code>,
<code>&amp;rsquo;</code> and rely on the browser to guarantee correct rendering.
This is the option I've gone with for now.
</li>
</ol>
