By a process of elimination, I've arrived at a conclusion that I should write Rust, or at least give
it a rigorous try. This might be a wrong conclusion, but the following is the reasoning.
</p>

Let us say I want to write a "native" program.

> This chain of thought started with thinking about writing a program that serves as my desktop background, slowly meandering though a pastel game of life, or floating through a Mandelbrot set. An xfdestkop replacement, as one would call it. But the specifics are not relevant, because then soon enough I started thinking in more general terms, say if I want to write an arbitrary "native" CLI program, etc.

My weapon of choice is TypeScript, and it is a sword light to wield, cutting through problems like butter. TypeScript also compiles to JavaScript, so it runs everywhere. Or does it?

While I can jump through hoops to compile JavaScript into a binary, this doesn't "feel" "solid". The point of writing a native program in the first place is to make it feel solid.

> Maybe this is preconception on my part, maybe one day the TypeScript -> JavaScript -> WASM -> binary pipeline will be straightforward, or maybe it already is and I just am not aware.

<p>
That leaves me with the following options (in an arbitrary order) — C, C++, go, Rust.
</p>

Technically, there are a lot more options, and I wrote a long section here about eliminating them piecewise, but after writing it I felt it was just noise — the reason why anything apart from these four is apparent to any discerning viewer, and I don't need to rant about it.

Of these, C++ is the easiest to eliminate. I once spent an entire year in the heaven of C++, walking around in daze of std::vector and RAII, before one day snapping out of it and realizing that I was just spawning complexity that is unrelated to the problem at hand. The experience was so vivid that I've never felt the urge to partake in C++ ever again.

So C, go and Rust. Let's begin.
